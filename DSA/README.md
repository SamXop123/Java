# 🧠 Java DSA Repository  

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my personal DSA repo.  
I’m building this to strengthen my problem-solving skills and to have all my DSA implementations neatly organized in one place.

This repo contains Java implementations of important algorithms and data structures. 
I also added some quick explainers as notes for myself, for each code.

### 💬 My Thought Process
I’m trying to build this repo in a way that even *future me* can come back and instantly recall the logic by reading my short notes.  
No over-explaining, just clear thoughts in my own words.
